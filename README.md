Crisis-and-Risk-Indexes_Study
=============================

Here I am studying crisis and risk indexes using R. I have selected four crisis indexes: 

  1. ECHO's vulnerability and crisis index. 
  2. UNU World Risk Index
  3. OCHA's Global Focus Model 
  4. ECHO's upcoming InfoRM (based on the Global Focus Model). 

At this time I just downloaded the databases from the original sources and standardized the country names using the R package 'countrycodes' (https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode).
